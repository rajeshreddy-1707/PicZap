### Introduction

Even a woman delivers a baby; she is left with stretch marks. You are giving birth to writers; your watermark is no less than those stretch marks. Now days watermark has many uses such as copyright protection, owner protection, add descriptive captions, etc.
We are working on watermarking of images using python and open CV. WE will also compare the watermarked images using PSNR, SSIM, RMSE, NRMSE, MSE. Other than watermarking, we will also give the options to crop an image, resize an image and compress an image to our software.

Watermarking is the process of superimposing a logo or a piece of a text on top of a document or image. It’s an important process when it comes to both the copyright protection and marketing of digital works.
We will do this with the help of open CV which is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning and image tampering. It helps us to automate the task. It will be very simple software and very easy to use so that even a person from non-coding background can make the best use of our software.

### Problem Statement

The problem statement of our app is that-
“PICZAP- A modern innovation towards watermarking”
❖	Compare the dataset of 2000 images to find the values
❖	User interactive phase for watermarking

#### SUBSYSTEM SERVICES

The services that will be provided by the our application will be-
- Comparison of the data
- Use interface (PICZAP)
  - Watermark
  - Adding
  -	Deleting
  -	Cropping
  -	Compressing
  -	Resizing

### KEY IMPLEMENTATIONS OUTLINES OF THE SYSTEM

Perpetration is the process that actually yields the smallest- position system rudiments in the system scale ( system breakdown structure). System rudiments are made, bought, or reused. Product involves the tackle fabrication processes of forming, removing, joining, and finishing, the software consummation processes of rendering and testing, or the functional procedures development processes for drivers' roles. However, a manufacturing system which uses the established specialized and operation processes may be needed, If perpetration involves a product process. 
 
 The purpose of the perpetration process is to design and produce (or fabricate) a system element conforming to that element’s design parcels and/ or conditions. The element is constructed employing applicable technologies and assiduity practices. This process bridges the system description processes and the integration process.

### SIGNIFICANT PROJECT OUTCOMES

The significant project outcomes are- the watermark image, cropped image, compresse image and the resized image.

### PROJECT APPLICABILITY ON REAL WORLD

The project is applicable on following set of things-

❖	If a user wants to add a watermark to his original work, the software can help him/her to protect his/her work from being directly copied by anyone.

❖	If a user adds a wrong image/text as a watermark then he/she may the watermark using this.

❖	If after doing the needful operations like adding and removing, if a user wants to actually compress, resize or crop an image he/she can actually do this, using this software in a very efficient way.
