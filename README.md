### Introduction

Even a mother who gives birth to a child has stretch marks. Your watermark is no less than those stretch marks since you are giving birth to writers. Today, watermarks are used for a variety of purposes, including adding descriptive captions, copyright protection, and owner protection.
Using Python and OpenCV, we are working on image watermarking. We will also use PSNR, SSIM, RMSE, NRMSE, and MSE to compare the watermarked images. In addition to watermarking, our software will also offer the ability to trim, resize, and compress images.

Watermarking is the process of superimposing a logo or a piece of a text on top of a document or image. It’s an important process when it comes to both the copyright protection and marketing of digital works.
We will do this with the help of open CV which is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning and image tampering. It helps us to automate the task. It will be very simple software and very easy to use so that even a person from non-coding background can make the best use of our software.

### Problem Statement

The problem statement of our app is that-
“PICZAP- A modern innovation towards watermarking”
❖	Compare the dataset of 2000 images to find the values
❖	User interactive phase for watermarking

#### SUBSYSTEM SERVICES

The services that will be provided by the our application will be-
- Comparison of the data
- Use interface (PICZAP)
  - Watermark
  - Adding
  -	Deleting
  -	Cropping
  -	Compressing
  -	Resizing

### SIGNIFICANT PROJECT OUTCOMES

The significant project outcomes are- the watermark image, cropped image, compresse image and the resized image.

### PROJECT APPLICABILITY ON REAL WORLD

The project is applicable on following set of things-

❖	If a user wants to add a watermark to his original work, the software can help him/her to protect his/her work from being directly copied by anyone.

❖	If a user adds a wrong image/text as a watermark then he/she may the watermark using this.

❖	If after doing the needful operations like adding and removing, if a user wants to actually compress, resize or crop an image he/she can actually do this, using this software in a very efficient way.
